        <h1>NASW Values</h1>
        <h4>Value: <span>Dignity and Worth of the Person</span></h4>
        <p>
            Understanding that just because someone is incarcerated does 
            not mean that she should be treated less than a human especially 
            when she is pregnant or recently delivered. The women’s body 
            during these times are the most vulnerable and need the most care. 
            By giving these women the care and time with their children even while 
            serving their sentence. It helps to continue to strengthen the parents-child relationship. 
        </p>
        <h4>Value: <span>Importance of Human Relationships</span></h4>
        <p>
            The most valuable relationship a person can have or will have is with their mother. 
            A relationship that starts far beyond the time of  birth. A child’s relationship with 
            their mother starts in the womb. When a mother breathes she's breathing for two. When 
            she eat she's eating for two. So having a mother  incarcerated already hurts the relationship. 
            Thankfully they understood the importance of allowing the mothers and children to still have that 
            time. And ensure that even in ail that their mother's safety and best interest are handled. 
            In order to help both the mother and child feel comfortable  in the situation they are in.
