        <h4>Value: <span><i>Dignity and Worth of the Person</i></span></h4>
        <p>
            Understanding that just because someone is incarcerated does not mean that she should be treated less than a 
            human, especially when she is pregnant or recently delivered. The women’s bodies during these times are the 
            most vulnerable and need the most care. By giving these women the care and time with their children even while 
            serving their sentence. It helps to continue to strengthen the parent-child relationship.

        <h4>Value: <span><i>Importance of Human Relationships</i></span></h4>
        <p>
            The most valuable relationship a person can have or will have is with their mother, a relationship that starts 
            far beyond the time of birth. A child’s relationship with their mother begins in the womb. When a mother 
            breathes, she is breathing for two. When she eats, she is eating for two. So having a mother incarcerated already 
            hurts the relationship. Thankfully they understood the importance of allowing the mothers and children to have 
            that time still. Moreover, ensure that even in ail that their mother's safety and best interest are handled. 
            To help both the mother and child feel comfortable in their situation.
