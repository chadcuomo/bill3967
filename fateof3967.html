            Thankfully, South Carolinaâ€™s 123rd General Assembly had no issues with passing Bill 3967 as an amendment to 
            the 1976 Code of Laws of South Carolina section 24-13.  The bill was passed unanimously, and quickly signed 
            into law by Governor Henry McMaster in May of this year (2020).  The amendments to the 1976 laws on the rights 
            of inmates will most likely increase as Americans become even more vocal about social justice reform.
