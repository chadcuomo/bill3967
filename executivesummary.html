        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>
            South Carolina House Bill 3967 was introduced during the 123rd general assembly.   The goal of this bill was to amend the 
            1976 Code of Laws of South Carolina by adding section 24-13-35 to address requirements of treating female inmates, and to 
            provide authorization of the periodic visits of inmates with their minor dependents. Out of the thirty-eight 
            representatives who originally sponsored the bill; twenty-five of the sponsors were members of the republican party, 
            thirteen from the democratic party.  The bill was passed without hesitation from the House to the Committee on Corrections 
            to the Senate, where it was voted to law unanimously. The bill was ratified and passed into law over the course of fifteen 
            months from February 13, 2019 to May 14, 2020 when it was signed by Governor McMasters.

            Nationwide, incarceration rates have been increasing exponentially for women.  As women are held in prisons and jails, 
            their families, especially the children, suffer.  According to federal and state demographic surveys, three-fourths of 
            female prisoners are prisoners, two-thirds with dependents under eighteen. Four to nine percent of women enter prison while 
            pregnant. Historically, it has been all too common for pregnant women not to have proper medical care while in prison.   
            Adequate healthcare is mandated to all inmates through the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution; however, women still are 
            provided scarcer healthcare and rehabilitative programs than men. As a result, many incarcerated women face unnecessarily 
            high-risk pregnancies.  The rapid growth of women’s incarceration means that recent criminal justice reforms have not kept 
            up with incarcerated women’s numbers and needs.  With such a high prevalence of imprisoned mothers, legislation needs to be put 
            into place to protect families.  Bill 3967 begins South Carolina’s work towards treating female prisoners more humanely, so that 
            families, especially children, have better outcomes in life.

            As social worker’s we must always evaluate legislation and policies through the lens of our National Association of Social Workers 
            (NASW) Code of Ethics.  As Bill 3967 is analyzed two key values stand out: <i>Dignity and Worth of the Person, and Importance of 
            Human Relationships.</i> Historically, prisoners have been treated as a lower class of society, or people who no longer were the 
            responsibility of society.  As humanists and social workers, it is crucial that we believe to our core that each person has worth 
            and deserves dignity.  As it will be discussed, creating better access to healthcare, feminine products, and trauma informed female 
            officers is incredibly important just to give that dignity back to a woman.

            When addressing female inmates, there is a high probability that many will be mothers.  The most valuable relationship, and the 
            first relationship a child has is with their mother.  As social workers, it is important to understand the advocacy needs of not 
            only the imprisoned but the effects that imprisonment has on a family unit, especially children.  Although South Carolina at 
            large is behind many states in offering nurseries for new mothers to raise their children and form bonds, it is taking a step 
            forward to make sure women can have less unnecessarily risky pregnancies while in prison.

            Thankfully, South Carolina’s 123rd General Assembly had no issues with passing Bill 3967 as an amendment to the 1976 Code of 
            Laws of South Carolina section 24-13.  The bill was passed unanimously, and quickly signed into law by Governor Henry 
            McMaster in May of this year (2020).  The amendments to the 1976 laws on the rights of inmates will most likely increase as 
            Americans become even more vocal about social justice reform.  
        </p>
        <p>
            In the coming years, it will be crucial for social workers to make sure that inmates are receiving the care they deserve.  
            On a micro level, they will be connecting and working with individual female inmates to secure proper resources and receive 
            appropriate medical treatment while incarcerated.  On a mezzo level, workers will be working with the prison to secure proper 
            resources and medical treatment for female inmates.  On a macro level, they will research and develop programs for pregnant 
            inmates to secure proper resources and medical treatment for female inmates. The macro-level social worker will work with 
            government agencies and advocates to create appropriate policies for incarcerated females. On every level, surveys or studies 
            will need to be collected to track the success of Bill 3967 and amendments like it that will follow.
