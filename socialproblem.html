            In America, women’s incarceration rates have increased exponentially over the past couple of decades.
            As women are held in prisons and jails, it is their families especially the children who suffer. 
            According to federal and state demographic surveys, three-fourths of female prisoners are prisoners, 
            two-thirds with dependents under eighteen years of age.  Multitudes of issues stand between incarcerated 
            women and their children resulting in behavioral challenges and compound emotional issues.  With such a 
            high prevalence of imprisoned mothers, legislation needs to be put into place to protect families.  
            Many mothers struggling with intersecting issues such as poverty, homelessness, lack of economic 
            opportunity, transportation barriers, etc. also have histories of physical and sexual trauma, and 
            substance abuse.  These mothers then become entangled with legal systems and child welfare systems, 
            and family preservation falls to the wayside.  For many single mothers, entering the legal system 
            means being forced to relinquish all parental rights as programs are not in place to support reunification
            or family preservation.

            Four to nine percent of women enter prison while pregnant. Historically, it has been all too common 
            for pregnant women to not have access to proper medical care while in prison. Adequate healthcare 
            is mandated to all inmates through the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, however, women still 
            are provided scarcer healthcare and rehabilitative programs than men. As a result, many incarcerated 
            women face unnecessarily high-risk pregnancies. On top of that, the practice of shackling women during 
            childbirth including labor, delivery, and postpartum has been a norm that increases the risk of 
            complications.  This practice is not only inhumane but poses a problem for healthcare providers in 
            cases of emergency.  After minimal education surrounding pregnancy, incarcerated females are likely 
            to have minimal if any post-birth bonding with their child. Many infants are taken away within the 
            first twenty-four hours following birth and handed over to kin or more commonly the foster care system.  From the start, these women are not given the opportunity to raise above their circumstance. They then become mothers without opportunity to connect and foster a supportive relationship with their child.

            Women report high rates of physical and sexual victimization during incarceration.  Only a handful 
            of correctional settings have specially trained staff to address the unique and pervasive needs 
            of female inmates.  The rapid growth of women’s incarceration means that recent criminal justice 
            reforms have not kept up with the number and needs of incarcerated women.  America’s prisons have 
            a long way to go to consider the needs of women, their families, and how to support long-term goals 
            of successful reintegration into society.
