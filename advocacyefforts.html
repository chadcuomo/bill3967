        <h2>Advocacy Efforts</h2>
        <p>
            To secure the proper treatment and resources given to incarcerated women in South Carolina, we would work with different 
            prisons throughout South Carolina to secure accurate data. In South Carolina, the Department of Corrections has 
            twenty-one institutions that house incarcerated women. We would gather research from different prisons and give 
            surveys to incarcerated females that are pregnant and not pregnant. The surveys will be issued to the social workers 
            in the different facilities, and the social workers will ensure that all surveys are completed accurately. Collecting 
            data from the females will identify the core issues so that advocacy efforts will reflect what is truly needed for the 
            incarcerated females. After collecting data, we will collaborate as a team to highlight needs. 
        </p>
        <p>In the case of SC bill 3967 discusses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Restraints on pregnant females
            </li>
            <li>
                Following nutritional guidelines for pregnant women to ensure they are receiving enough food
            </li>
            <li>
                Placement for pregnant females or female that have given birth within 30 days 
            </li>
            <li>
                Prohibiting females to sleep on elevated beds 
            </li>
            <li>
                Ensuring that females are provided with sufficient menstrual products 
            </li>
            <li>
                Limits body searched for females by male officers with no clothing or limited clothing
            </li>
            <li>
                Visitation for minor dependents once a week to their mother
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Listed above outlines the core issues within South Carolina facilities that house female inmates, which is why SC 
            Bill 3967 was created, and where the questions from the survey will stem. Micro, Mezzo, and Macro policy advocacy 
            efforts will all be geared towards the outcome of the data collected from the surveys. Listed below is what purposes 
            each level will be responsible for potential advocacy efforts. 
        </p>
        <h2>Micro</h2>
        <p>
            <u>Purpose:</u> Connecting and working with individual female inmates to secure proper resources and 
            receive appropriate medical treatment, while incarcerated.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Implementation:</u> The Micro Social Worker will work individually with the inmates. The social worker will 
            be responsible for ensuring that all females receive proper medical treatment and resources. Suppose the social 
            worker is aware that a female is not receiving proper treatment or resources. In that case, he/she is responsible 
            for securing resources and advocating on behalf of the inmates. 
        </p>
        <p>This may be making sure more that, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Ordering supplies for the inmates 
            </li>
            <li>
                Arranging medical appointments
            </li>
            <li>
                conducting one on one sessions for females inmates for counseling
            </li>
            <li>
                reporting to the appropriate supervisor about issues on behalf of the inmates
            </li>
            <li>
                collecting data on issues that may arise with inmates to report
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The Micro Social Workers are vital to advocating efforts because they work directly with the inmates and know what the 
            issues are when they arise. Prison Social Workers need to create a healthy relationship with the inmates, so the 
            Social Worker can effectively complete their work and ensure proper treatment and resources are secured. The Micro 
            Social Worker will be responsible for issuing the surveys and ensuring that it is accurately completed and passing it 
            to the Mezzo Social Worker. 
        </p>
        <h2>Mezzo</h2>

            <u>Purpose:</u> To advocate and serve female inmates within the public, while working with the 
            prison to secure proper resources and medical treatment for female inmates.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Implementation:</u> The Mezzo Social Workers will work with the micro and mezzo social workers to ensure that 
            resources and treatment are secure. The Mezzo Social Worker will connect the resources and treatment within the 
            community. This may be making certain more that, but are not limited to:

            <li>
                Connecting resources in the community to the facilities
            </li>
            <li>
                Ensuring funding is made available for resources
            </li>
            <li>

            <li>
                Creating group sessions with inmates to ensure resource and treatment is secure
            </li>
            <li>
                Organizing and create policies
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The Mezzo Social Worker will be responsible for linking and securing resources to the facilities, workers, inmates, 
            and the community. The Mezzo Social Worker will collect all surveys, pinpoint core issues with the South Carolina 
            prison system, and pass the Macro Social Worker information.
        </p>
        <h2>Macro</h2>
        <p>
            <u>Purpose:</u> Research and develop programs for pregnant inmates to secure proper resources and medical treatment 
            for female inmates. The macro-level social worker will work with government agencies and advocates to create appropriate 
            policies for incarcerated females. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Implementation:</u> The Macro Social Workers will work in and with the government agencies to develop policies on 
            behalf of women inmates in South Carolina. These Social Workers will present the information gathered from surveys 
            and policies that will need to be implemented on behalf of the inmates to ensure proper treatment and resources are available. 
            This may be making sure more that, but are not limited to:

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The macro-level social workers will be responsible for policies and laws created and passed to ensure positive change for 
            the incarcerated females. They will create and adjust policies to ensure that core issues are addressed.  After each 
            level of an advocacy effort has been implemented, efforts will be re-evaluated to ensure all resources and treatments 
            are arranged adequately for all institutions that house females. If advocacy efforts are successful, policies implemented 
            will be secured for all South Carolina females for years to come.
